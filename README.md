In this paper, a model has been put forward for the prediction of the Closing prices of the stock by using BLSTM based Seq2Seq Model. 
Seq2Seq model is used as it helps in the mapping of the input-sequence to the output-sequence. 
This proposed model was compared with various existing algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision tree and Linear Regression.
